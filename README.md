# Managed Identity and Key Vault with ASP.NET Core

> Build an ASP.NET Core Web API using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as a Docker container

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor

> Instructions for setting up Key Vault, ACR, Azure Monitor and Cosmos DB are in the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work with WSL1
  - Will not work in Cloud Shell unless you have a remote dockerd
- .NET Core SDK 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine
  - All instructions assume starting from the root of the repo

### Build the container using Docker

- The unit tests run as part of the Docker build process. You can also run the unit tests manually.
- For instructions on building the container with ACR, please see the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image
docker build . -t helium-csharp

```

### Run the application locally

- The application requires Key Vault and Cosmos DB to be setup per the Helium [readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
  - You can run the application locally by using Azure CLI cached credentials
    - You must run az login before this will work

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
cd src/app

# run in the background
# $He_Name is set to the name of your key vault
# this will use Azure CLI cached credentials
dotnet run -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI &

# test the application
# the application takes about 10 seconds to start
curl http://localhost:4120/healthz

# Stop the app
fg

# press ctl-c

```

### Run the application as a local container instead

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo

# build the dev image
# docker-dev builds a full .NET Core SDK image with Azure CLI installed in the container
# you may see red warnings in the build output, they are safe to ignore
# examples: "debconf: ..." or "dpkg-preconfigure: ..."

docker build . -t helium-dev -f Dockerfile-Dev

# run the container
# mount your ~/.azure directory to container root/.azure directory
# you can also run the container and run az login from a bash shell

docker run -d -p 4120:4120 --name helium-dev -v ~/.azure:/root/.azure helium-dev dotnet run -- --keyvault-name $He_Name --auth-type CLI

# check the logs
# re-run until the application started message appears

docker logs helium-dev

# curl the health check endpoint

curl http://localhost:4120/healthz


# Stop and remove the container

docker stop helium-dev
docker rm helium-dev

```
